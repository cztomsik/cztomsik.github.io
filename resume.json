    "summary": "Hi, right now, I am probably working on some contract as a full-stack developer. I am not actively looking for any new opportunities, but you can of course try to reach me via email. I prefer to use JavaScript/TypeScript and I also have a solid experience with Java, Kotlin, Rust and PHP, in case you need it, but it's not something I'd like to do on a day-to-day basis.",
