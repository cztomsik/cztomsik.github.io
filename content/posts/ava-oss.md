title: Ava is now open source
---

After 4 months of work, I am happy to announce that my project,
[Ava PLS](https://avapls.com), is now open source!

Ava is an all-in-one **desktop application** for running LLMs **locally**. It
uses llama.cpp under the hood, so it is compatible with most GGUF models on
[huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co).

You can download it from [avapls.com](https://avapls.com). It is available for
Mac and Windows. A Linux version will eventually be released too, but I can't
promise when exactly.

It also includes a built-in downloader for several models, so you don't need to
spend time searching for the right model and downloading it manually.

## Why not open source from the beginning?

When I started the project, I kept it private because I was hoping that I might
be able to monetize it somehow. I was definitely not expecting to get rich or
anything but every successful project needs some kind of funding.

I was thinking about two possible ways:

1. I could sell it as a desktop app on the Mac App Store. But IMHO there are not
   many people who would pay for such an app.

2. I might be able to sell **white-label** version of the app to companies that
   would like to use it for their internal projects. But this never happened,
   unfortunately.

So I decided to open source it. I am releasing Ava under the MIT license. I hope
you'll find it useful, and I'm looking forward to your feedback and/or
contributions.

## What's next?

Obviously, I don't want to stop working on Ava, but it's not my primary project
anymore. I will be working on it in my free time, and I will be focusing on
features that I personally need.

If you'd like to use Ava in your company, I am open to doing some custom
development for you. Feel free to contact me at [info@tomsik.cz](mailto:info@tomsik.cz).

I can also do training for your team, or I can help you with integrating Ava
into your existing projects.

You can find Ava on [GitHub](https://github.com/cztomsik/ava)
