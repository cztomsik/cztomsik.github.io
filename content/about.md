## Kamil Tomšík

Independent Software Engineer

Hi, I'm Kamil, a software engineer from Brno, Czech Republic. I'm a
big fan of open source and I'm passionate about programming and
technology in general. I have a strong background in web development
but I'm also getting into machine learning and systems programming.

I'm currently working on [Ava PLS](https://www.avapls.com), an
air-gapped virtual assistant.
